# date-a-scientist

Date-a-scientist represents the capstone project from a machine learning course based in python
This project uses a dataset from OKCupid containing parameters of members of its site such as height, weight, and income.
Using multiple regression methodologies, we try and predict one parameter using others. (i.e. using height and weight to predict income).

The .py file is the main code that imports the data set, cleans the data, and runs the popular SciKitLearn regressors against the data.
The results are published to the powerpoint.
